# This configuration will be inherited by every "test" document in the

format:
  # `markdown` (not `md`) is the "full" Pandoc Markdown format.
  # It notably supports the Definition List. This is particularly useful to
  # easily check that the output corresponds to what we expect, in a "neutral"
  # format (e.g., not HTML, nor PDF).
  markdown:
    # We want to force "atx" headings, e.g., `# Header 1`.
    markdown-headings: "atx"
    # Do not keep the original YAML (metadata), we just want the "rendered"
    # text. This does not seem to work...
    keep-yaml: false
    # We want to preserve wrappings to be able to compare line-by-line
    # (i.e., no additional line break will be added).
    wrap: "preserve"

filters:
  # Load the `acronyms` filter. This requires a symlink to the `_extensions`
  # folder!
  - acronyms
